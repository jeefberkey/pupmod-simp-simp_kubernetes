## Description

Minimally manage a Kubernetes cluster! This module will configure systems to
get out of the way of kubeadm, while allowing the rest of SIMP to coexist. It is
intended to be used with modern versions of kubernetes.

(Source: https://speakerdeck.com/luxas/kubeadm-cluster-creation-internals-from-self-hosting-to-upgradability-and-ha)

This module can set up:
* iptables ports required for the master and the nodes
* kubeconfigs

This module will not interact with Kubernetes in any way, besides what can be
configured on a system level.

**NOTE:** This module only supports EL7.  **It does not support EL6.**

### This is a SIMP module

This module is a component of the [System Integrity Management
Platform](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/SIMP), a
compliance-management framework built on Puppet.

If you find any issues, they may be submitted to our [bug
tracker](https://simp-project.atlassian.net/).

This module is optimally designed for use within a larger SIMP ecosystem, but
it can be used independently:

 * When included within the SIMP ecosystem, security compliance settings will
   be managed from the Puppet server, but only on the systems running kubernetes,
   not the content in kubernetes.
 * If used independently, all SIMP-managed security subsystems are disabled by
   default and must be explicitly opted into by administrators.  Please review
   the parameters in
   [`simp/simp_options`](https://github.com/simp/pupmod-simp-simp_options) for
   details.


## Setup

### What simp_kubernetes affects

simp_kubernetes only sets up the services listed above, with a few catches:

* This module does not deploy anything on kubernetes, even if they are
  required for a complete set up

 **NOTE:** This module only supports EL7.  **It does not support EL6.**


### Usage

The minimal set up would look as follows:


##### On all nodes:
```puppet
include 'simp_kubernetes'
```
or in hiera:
```yaml
---
classes:
  - simp_kubernetes
```


##### On the master node:
```puppet
class { 'simp_kubernetes':
  is_master    => true
}
```
or in the hiera configuration for master nodes, assuming the hiera for all nodes listed above
is present:
```yaml
---
classes:
  - simp_kubernetes
simp_kubernetes::is_master: true
```

## Reference

Please refer to the [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md), generated by Puppet strings.

## Limitations

This module is only intended to work with RedHat's distribution of kubernetes.
If a newer version is required or a version from a different source, this module
may not work as intended.

SIMP Puppet modules are generally intended for use on Red Hat Enterprise Linux
and compatible distributions, such as CentOS. Please see the
[`metadata.json` file](./metadata.json) for the most up-to-date list of
supported operating systems, Puppet versions, and module dependencies.

## Development

Please read our [Contribution Guide](http://simp-doc.readthedocs.io/en/stable/contributors_guide/index.html).

### Acceptance tests

This module includes [Beaker](https://github.com/puppetlabs/beaker) acceptance
tests using the SIMP [Beaker Helpers](https://github.com/simp/rubygem-simp-beaker-helpers).
By default the tests use [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) with
[VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org) as a back-end; Vagrant and VirtualBox
must both be installed to run these tests without modification. To execute the
tests run the following:

```shell
bundle install
bundle exec rake beaker:suites
```

Please refer to the [SIMP Beaker Helpers documentation](https://github.com/simp/rubygem-simp-beaker-helpers/blob/master/README.md)
for more information.
